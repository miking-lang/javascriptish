# JavaScriptish

JavaScriptish is a small and simple superset of a pure subset of the JavaScript language. JavaScriptish is
particularly designed for teaching beginner courses in fundamental
programming.

## Installation

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install [OCaml and OPAM](https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html)
3. Install js\_of\_ocaml using OPAM, by executing command `>>opam install js_of_ocaml`.
4. Clone or fork the [JavaScriptish GitHub repo](https://github.com/miking-lang/javascriptish)
5. Run `make` in the project root folder.


##  Getting Started

Go to directory `test`. This folder contains a number of small JavaScriptish files (with ending `.jsh`). If you are in directory `test` and execute the command

`>> ./jsh fact-imp.jsh`

file `fact-imp.jsh` is executed. File `fact-imp.jsh` contains the following code:

```javascript
function fact(n){
  var res=1
  while(n>1){
    res = res * n
    n = n - 1
  }
  return res
}

print(fact(5))
```

The example uses a pure subset of normal JavaScript, with the
exception for printing. In JavaScriptish, a call to `print` outputs
text to the standard output.


## Language Overview

The current version of JavaScriptish is a pure subset of JavaScript,
which includes the following constructs:

* while loops
* if statements
* function declarations
* return statement
* booleans and integers
* variable and constant declarations
* assignments
* function calls
* strings
* arrays

### Missing constructs
The following JavaScript constructs are still missing

* Classes
* Objects
* Numbers (floating point)
* Anonymous functions


### Some design decisions

The language is designed to avoid some common beginner mistakes. For instance:

* `while` loops and `if` statements always need to have scopes defined using `{` and `}`.
     It is not possible to have a single statement without defining a scope.

*  Assignments `=` are only allowed in a statement, and not within an expression.


### Extensions

Besides the pure subset of JavaScript described above, our plan is to
extend JavaScriptish with a few more language features. The main
purpose of these extensions is to make it easy to
teach functional language concepts. This is work in progress. Some of
the concepts that are planned are the following:

* Tuples, as in functional languages such as OCaml and Haskell.
* Gradual typing (to be able to mix static and dynamic typing).
* Algebraic data types as in Haskell and OCaml.
